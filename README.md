# AF_to_LAMMPS
This Python-based repository contains code and examples for converting Alphafold predictions and stuctural data into amino-acid level coarse-grained polymer models in LAMMPS. The methodology seeks to preserves the order and disorder regions of simulated protein chains.

# Required Downloads
To generate elastic networks from B-factor calculations, we make use of FitNMA described by Koehl, Orland, and Delarue (doi: 10.1002/jcc.26701) which can be downloaded here[https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Projects/index.html]

To fit chains into a simulation box, we make use of Packmol described by Martinez et al. (doi: 10.1002/jcc.21224) which can be downloaded here[https://m3g.github.io/packmol/ciA%20package%20for%20building%20initial%20configurations%20for%20molecular%20dynamics%20simulations.%20Jtation.shtml]
